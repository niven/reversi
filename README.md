reversi
=======

Play Reversi/Othello against increasing difficulty computer opponents.

This is an implementation of Reversi that will one day beat Eric.

The rules:
I read only what is on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi and then implement a different "generation" of
computer opponent every so often. Every generation will be something I can implement in a few hours, I'm hoping 
for weekly ones since I have run out of Round Tuits long ago. Eric thought it would take me around 50 generations
to beat him.

I have no prior knowledge about this game at all, and won't start reading books about it either, to keep it fair.

You can play by just openening reversi.html in any modern browser that supports JavaScript 1.6 or so.
